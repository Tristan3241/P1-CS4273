# P1-CS4273
Project 1 for Capstone

We are using GitHub Actions to complete our regression testing. This is done with the help of Maven and JUnit. Before a commit is pushed to the main branch GitHub Actions will verify the code is still passing our designated unit tests to ensure we haven't broken anything while changing the code. 

We also used the AWS lab in order to do the programming for the CSVParser.java and the TestCSVParser.java

Used GitHub Actions and Java with Maven in order to do the testing
