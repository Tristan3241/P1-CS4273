Project 1 for Capstone

We are using GitHub Actions to complete our regression testing. This is done with the help of Maven and JUnit. Before a commit is pushed to the main branch GitHub Actions will verify the code is still passing our designated unit tests to ensure we haven't broken anything while changing the code.
